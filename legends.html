                    <h3>Bangalore</h3>
                    <p> 
                        Don’t be fooled, despite her rugged exterior and military precision, 
                        Anita Williams has a more noble cause for entering the Apex Games. 
                        Separated from her family during a military mission, she’s raising the funds to fight her way back.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Bloodhound</h3>
                    <p>
                        The identity of Bloodhound is unknown. Rumours range from the crow-clad hunter 
                        being fabulously wealthy to living the life of a slave in a past life.
                    </p>

                <!--Caustic-->

                    <h3>Caustic</h3>
                    <p>
                        Once a scientist named Alexander Nox who worked for the Frontier’s leading pesticide gases manufacturer, 
                        he would be changed irrevocably after deciding to test a stronger formula on himself. Each to their own. 
                        But, for that unfortunate reason.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <!--Crypto-->

                    <h3>Crypto</h3>
                    <p>
                        The hacker-come-fugitive Crypto joins Bloodhound in being Apex Legend’s other tracker Legend. 
                        He uses his aerial drones to scout out terrain and watch his back for foes in the Apex Arena.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Gibraltar</h3>
                    <p>
                        Gibraltar likes to protect people as much as he likes to bring the pain. He’s known as the wild, 
                        but gentle giant for good reason: his father lost an arm saving him and his boyfriend from mudslide
                        after the pair stole his bike and went joy riding.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Horizon</h3>
                    <p>
                        Almost a century ago, the Outlands were dangling on the edge of a cataclysmic energy crisis. 
                        Dr. Mary Somers, a charmingly eccentric astrophysicist, was hired to find a solution.
                        With the help of her apprentice, Dr. Reid, Mary discovered Branthium - an element she was 
                        convinced could be the key to limitless energy.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Lifeline</h3>
                    <p>
                        Ajay Che is a healer with a heavy conscience. Once part of a family of wealthy war profiteers, 
                        Che left once she truly realised the extent of her kin’s repugnant business.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Loba</h3>
                    <p>
                        Loba is the new Apex Legends character for Season 5, 
                        a master thief with teleportation and loot stealing abilities.

                    <h3>Mirage</h3>
                    <p>
                        Another member of the eclectic cast of Apex Legends heroes, 
                        Elliot Witt distinguishes himself by emphasising stealth tactics over out-and-out physical prowess. 
                        Someone who likes to out-Witt his opponents, if you will.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <!--Octane-->

                    <h3>Octane</h3>
                    <p>
                        This zippy chap used to belong to a family of wealth and fortune before turning to a life of stunts 
                        to abate his boredom. That decision cost him his legs after he used a grenade to complete a speed run,
                    </p>
                </div>

                <!--Pathfinder-->

                    <h3>Pathfinder</h3>
                    <p>
                        Pathfinder is forward in his thinking as well as in what he says. 
                        Apparently, he booted up over a decade ago in an abandoned laboratory
                        and has been on the lookout for his creator ever since.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <!--Rampart-->

                    <h3>Rampart</h3>
                    <p>
                        Rampart is an expert modder, ready to battle anyone in her way. 
                        With her trusty minigun, Sheila, at her side and the ability to 
                        create cover, she’s the best Legend for standing her ground.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Revenant</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our red assassin may be synthetic but he’s certainly not sympathetic. 
                        Revenant introduced himself to the Apex faithful by taking out competitor-to-be Forge. 
                        As the story goes, Revenant used to be human before Hammond Robotics turned him into a 
                        machine. He’s not best pleased about that.
                    </p>

                <!--Wattson-->

                    <h3>Wattson</h3>
                    <p>
                    Perky engineer, Natalie ‘Wattson’ Paquette is no stranger to the Apex Games,
                    having helped build its Modified Containment Ring alongside her father, 
                    who was the Games’ lead electrical engineer.

                    <h3>Wraith</h3>
                    <p>
                        We know little of the mysterious Wraith apart from the fact that she woke in a 
                        detention facility years ago with voices in her head. Once she started listening 
                        to them, she acquired powers that allow her to jump between dimensions.
