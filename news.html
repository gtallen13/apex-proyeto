                    <h1>Season 07 Patch Notes</h1>
                    <h3>Map Rotation</h3>
                    <p>
                        With the new season comes a new map and Respawn is thinning out the map rotation. 
                        For the first two weeks, players will only be able to dive into Olympus in casual 
                        games and in the limited-time Olympus Preview mode.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Legend Adjustments</h3>
                    <h4>Bangalore</h4>
                    <p>
                        Bangalore’s ultimate will deploy faster, in six seconds instead of eight. 
                        The shorter fuse “will encourage enemies to leave the zone slightly faster,”
                        and it could also increase the ability’s synergy with Horizon’s ultimate. 
                        A faster deployment time means that using the two in conjunction becomes more comfortable.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Caustic</h4>
                    <p>
                        Caustic’s traps will also see significant changes. The blurred-vision effect of the Nox Gas 
                        is out of the picture, but to make up for lost power, Respawn is buffing its damage. Ticks 
                        deal increasing damage ranging from six to 12 health instead of four to 10.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Mirage</h4>
                    <p>
                        Mirage mains are getting a new toy. The trickster’s decoys now have 45 health but won’t work as a shield. 
                        Any bullet that hits the hologram will continue to travel normally until it hits another object. Decoys 
                        will also flicker temporarily after being shot to help discern between the real Mirage and his clones.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Octane</h4>
                    <p>
                        Octane’s heal rate will double to one health per second, which allows the daredevil to
                        regenerate much faster and be more aggressive—just like Octane should be.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Wattson</h4>
                    <p>
                        Wattson’s fences are getting a boost and are ready to stop anything in her tracks.
                        The damage of her tactical will increase to 15 from a previous 10, which makes her 
                        fences even deadlier. Players will want to triple-check a room before storming through the door.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Loba</h4>
                    <p>
                        Loba’s Black Market is getting an upgrade. Players can stock up on all the ammunition they 
                        want without burning through a slot, which is perfect to solve your team’s loot needs.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Rampart</h4>
                    <p>
                        Rampart’s ordnances will get to work much quicker. The new patch will drop Sheila’s 
                        spin-up time to 1.25 seconds (down from two) and amped cover will trigger after just
                        three seconds instead of the previous four.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Pathfinder</h4>
                    <p>
                        Pathfinder’s changes aren’t confined to his kit. Respawn updated his hitbox to make him 
                        a little easier to hit, but he’s still harder to hit than other legends. The developers 
                        also maintained the Low Profile passive, which increases incoming damage.
                    </p>
                    <img src="./src/images/pathfinder_hb.png">
                    <p>
                        Pathfinder’s Grappling Hook is going under the knife, too. Respawn is pushing an intense 
                        variant of the recent changes to his tactical. His cooldown is capped at 30 seconds, which,
                        accounting for animations, means that the downtime won’t be larger than 35 seconds in total.
                        Respawn has doubled the amount of distance necessary to reach the maximum cooldown and will
                        allow the Grappling Hook to be considered “finished” even if the legend isn’t touching the floor.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Weapon Meta</h3>
                    <p>
                        The new season is bringing key balancing changes to some weapons, too, including the 
                        reintroduction of the R-99 as ground loot and the Prowler’s move to care package territory.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Hemlok</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Hemlok will receive a different recoil pattern, which applies mostly to the burst-fire
                        mode, and its headshot multiplier will also drop to 1.75 (39 damage instead of 44). 
                        The Havoc will follow a similar route and get an overhauled recoil pattern.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Sentinel</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Sentinel will see a significant boost. Instead of its old Disruptor effect, which 
                        dealt extra damage against shields, charging up the sniper rifle will increase its damage
                        across the board from 70 to 88.
                    </p>

                    <h4>New Hop-Up</h4>
                    <p>
                        Players will also encounter a new hop-up called Quickdraw Holster, applicable for the 
                        Wingman and RE-45. It decreases weapon swap time, hipfire spread, and holster animations.
                        Wingman users will have to choose between the new hop-up and the Skullpiercer, 
                        which increases headshot damage.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Game Meta</h3>
                    <h4>Evo Shields</h4>
                    <ul class="game_meta_list">
                        <li>Level zero to one: 100 damage (from 50)</li>
                        <li>Level one to two: 150 damage (from 125)</li>
                        <li>Level two to three: 300 damage (from 250)</li>
                        <li>Level three to four: 750 damage (from 500)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>The Ring</h4>
                    <ul class="game_meta_list">
                        <li>Ring one: Two percent per tick (same)</li>
                        <li>Ring two: Three percent per tick (from five percent)</li>
                        <li>Ring three: Five percent per tick (from 10 percent)</li>
                        <li>Ring four: 10 percent per tick (from 20 percent)</li>
                        <li>Ring five: 10 percent per tick (from 20 percent)</li>
                        <li>Ring six: 15 percent per tick (from 25 percent)</li>
                        <li>Ring seven: 15 percent per tick (from 25 percent)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h1>Game Updates</h1>
                    <h3>Welcome to Olympus</h3>
                    <cite>Dave Osei, Senior Level Designer (Apex Legends)</cite>
                    <p>
                        Olympus is the third map coming to Apex Legends and is a floating city 
                        high above the planet Psamathe. This new location boasts lush, artificial
                        terrain with stylised landscapes for those that appreciate opulent decor.
                        Gone are the tall, cliffside rocks from Kings Canyon and World’s Edge. 
                        Instead, you’ll find perilous open space that showcases the clouds below.
                        Olympus comes with two new ways to traverse the map: the Phase Runner and the Trident, 
                        Apex Legends’ first vehicle.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Traversing Olympus</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Trident is a squad-based, three-seater hover vehicle you can find on the outskirts of Olympus. 
                        These were made for large rotations throughout the map, especially in the early game. The Trident 
                        comes equipped with a boost feature that for a short time, can increase speed and help you get over obstacles.
                    </p>
                    <div class="grid-2">
                        <img class="travOlympus_images" src="./src/images/traversing_olympus.jpg">
                        <p>
                            It’s also worth mentioning that if you accidentally drive the Trident off the map, don’t worry! We have a 
                            safety net in place that will launch all players into the sky so you can safely land back onto Olympus. 
                            The Trident does not respawn, so please be careful!
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="grid-2">
                        <p>
                            Last but certainly not least is the Phase Runner; an industrial sized phase portal connecting three distinct 
                            areas of Olympus. This always-on, static portal will phase players to and from specific locations. If the ring 
                            is pushing you towards Hydroponics, and you’re stuck with no Trident in sight, hop into the Phase Runner to phase
                            you to the other side of the map. However, be cautious when using these, as you have no clue what’s waiting 
                            for you on the other side.
                        </p>

                            Olympus houses many challenges and playstyles for a very different experience than you’re used to. 
                            The Phase Runner and Trident are exciting new tools to traverse to each zone. From the seedy 
                            underbelly of Energy Depot to the glistening Bonsai Plaza, Olympus will give you new experiences, 
                            new environments, and new ways to test your skills. 

                            <br><br>The city awaits… see you soon!
